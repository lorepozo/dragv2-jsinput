dragv2
======

Designed with problem creators in mind, dragv2 problems can be made _without writing any code_.
Features of dragv2 include:
* multi-touch/mobile support
* _very_ responsive
* draggables can be .svg files, among several other file types (.png, .jpg, ...)
* draggables start at a custom location on the drop image
* draggables snap to their initial location (reusable draggables delete when this happens)
* reset button is _always_ present
* simple and readable XML with JSInput
* easily create sophisticated custom grading methods (_via python code_, see `documentation.html`)
* built-in capability for custom CSS formatting of draggables: default _and_ hover
* optional draggable expansion on hover (pre-written CSS)
* one special (readable) JSON file in the static folder per problem (on top of image files)
